# README file for the project

This project contains 4 Python files: `strassen_sequential.py`, `strassen_parallel.py`, `straight.py`, and `straight_parallel.py`.

## Installation

The project requires the NumPy package. To install NumPy, you can use pip, the package installer for Python:

Copy code

`pip3 install numpy` 

## Running the scripts

### `strassen_sequential.py`

This script contains a sequential implementation of the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication. To run it, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file. Then, run the following command:

Copy code

`python3 strassen_sequential.py` 

### `strassen_parallel.py`

This script contains a parallel implementation of the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication. To run it, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file. Then, run the following command:

Copy code

`python3 strassen_parallel.py` 

### `straight.py`

This script contains a sequential implementation of the standard algorithm for matrix multiplication. To run it, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file. Then, run the following command:

Copy code

`python3 straight.py` 

### `straight_parallel.py`

This script contains a parallel implementation of the standard algorithm for matrix multiplication. To run it, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file. Then, run the following command:

Copy code

`python3 straight_parallel.py`
